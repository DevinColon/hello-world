My first Repository

Hi, my name is Devin Colon and I attend Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. I'm interested in learning more ways in making a website more interactive. I'm currently learning Javascript and ways I could style a website. I'm looking to collaborate with other beginner coders. I can be reached at dcol6826@taehs.org.
